  Hands on exercise question 1 for review quiz (tut.10)
  
  Assume that you've been asked to create JavaScript code that displays a calendar for the current month in an iframe on a web page. (Like you did in Case 3)

Your client has provided you with the web page and a set of 12 files named Jan.html, Feb.html, Mar.html etc. 

Your client has also provided you with an external JavaScript file called dateStuff.js that contains a function called getMonthAbbrev() that takes no parameters and returns the 3 character abbreviation of the current month.

Write a script block that contains a JavaScript function
The name of the function is showCalendar. It takes no parameters.
Declare a variable called thisMonth that stores the value returned from a call to the getMonthAbbrev() function.
Write the opening iframe tag to the web page. The src attribute for the iframe should be the name of the file for this month.
Write the closing iframe tag to the web page.
Write a script block that calls the function to show the calendar.
 
 <script>
	function showCalendar()
	{
		var thisMonth = getMonthAbbrev();
		document.write('<iframe src="'+thisMonth+'.html">');
		document.write("</iframe>");
	}
 </script>
 
 <script>
	showCalendar();
 </script>

  Assume that you've been asked to create a JavaScript function definition called getPartOfWeek.  It takes no parameters.  It returns either "Weekday" or "Weekend" using the current date/time.
Write a script block that contains a JavaScript function
The name of the function is getPartOfWeek. It takes no parameters.
Declare a variable today and set it equal to the current date/time.
Declare a variable day and set it equal to the weekday frm today. 
Declare a variable output and set it equal to the empty string.
Use the conditional operator or an if statement to assign "weekday" or "weekend" to the variable outpu based on the value in the variable day.  Sunday will have a value of 0.  Monday will have a value of 1.  Monday - Friday are weekdays.  Saturday and Sunday are weekends.
Return the value in the variable output.
Write a script block that calls the function to show whether it is the weekend or weekday in the web page, in the form called calendarForm, in an input tag called weekend.
 
 <script>
	function getPartOfWeek()
	
	{
	var today = new Date();
	var day = today.getDay();
	var output = "";
	
	if (day == 0 || day == 6)
		output = "weekend";
	else 
		output = "weekday";
		 
	return output;
	}
	
 </script>
 
 <script>
	document.calendarForm.weekend.value = getPartOfWeek();
 </script>
